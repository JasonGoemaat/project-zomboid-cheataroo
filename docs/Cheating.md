# Cheating

In Steam, enable debug mode.   Right-click on the game, go to "Properties" and you
should see 'GENERAL'.   At the bottom is 'LAUNCH OPTIONS', add '-debug'.

**Vehicles** - Get in front of a vehicle and hit 'V' to open the vehicle radial.
Click on the 'Open Hood' or 'Vehicle Mechanics' (same thing?).  Right-click and
make sure 'DBG:ISVehicleMechanics.cheat' is false.  Then you can right-click and
access debug options such as 'CHEAT: Repair Vehicle', get a key, etc.

**Doors** - You can right-click on a door to bring up the context menu and under
`[DEBUG] Objects` you can unlock it.

**Teleport** - Simply right-click on the ground or map and pick 'Teleport Here'

**Items** - You can right-click on items and edit them, useful for setting weapon
damage, range, etc. if you don't want to mod

# Notes

There are some pages saying to edit the batch files in the game directory to pass `-Ddebug`
to the java command, but I don't think that's necessary)
